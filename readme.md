🙌🏼 Alldone. 🙌🏼

Now, if there's a line in the txt file that will produce an error, tweetbot acknowledges the error, shows the Twitter API response, and moves on. I cleared out the tweets from my user (https://twitter.com/botsauceswag) so after creds are provided, this can run through completely without getting the duplicate tweet error message, except where it's supposed to. I've given my token information to Mary via email :)

One qualm I have with the exercise overall - anyone who does it is pushing Twitter API/OAuth keys to (most likely) a public repo. We should make the Debugging_Test repo private, grant access to users as they're interviewing, and allow them to create & push to branches that aren't master. Would keep all those fun Twitter creds out of the open, where I'm sure there are plenty of bots scanning public Github repos for them.

I also saw that Twython lets you post messages with images/videos? This... could be useful :)
